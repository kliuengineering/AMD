# openSIL Modular Unit-Test Logs

## Description
- This repository is dedicated to the R&D of a research project with AMD.
- All enclosed files are intended to be open-sourced upon release.

## Objectives
- To survey various strategies for unit tests.
- To research AI methodology for test automation.

## Phase One - Infrastructure Setup
Link: [Phase 1 Documentation](Phase1.md)

Timeline
- Start Date: November 27, 2024
- End Date: December 9, 2024

Abstract
- Setting up the development environment for UT.

## Phase Two - Intro to Unit Test
